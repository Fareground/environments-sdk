"""Derived rules — the unified inference layer.

## What problem this solves

Today, "when X then Y" lives in four different schema shapes:
  1. ``triggers``         — event-driven (when event of type T fires)
  2. ``effects.condition`` — inline conditional on a specific effect
  3. state-machine ``transitions[].when`` — phase-state guards
  4. ``termination_conditions`` — when game ends

All four use the same predicate language (P4), but the SHAPES differ.
A game author thinking in terms of rules has to mentally translate.

## What derived_rules is

A SINGLE rule format that runs at the world level, every round, with
forward-chaining semantics:

    derived_rules: [
      {
        "name": "death_when_zero_hp",
        "when": "$actor.hp <= 0 && $actor.alive",
        "for_each": "$alive_of(Unit)",
        "as": "actor",
        "then": [
          {"operation": "set", "target": "$params.actor",
           "field": "alive", "value": false},
          {"operation": "emit_event", "value": "unit_died",
           "actor_id": "$params.actor"}
        ],
        "once_per_entity": true
      }
    ]

Each round (after agent turns + before termination check), the rule
walks every entity in ``for_each``, evaluates ``when`` with that
entity bound, and if true → fires ``then``. ``once_per_entity`` keeps
the rule from re-firing for the same entity (e.g. a unit dies once).

## Why this matters

This IS forward-chaining inference, exposed as JSON. A user thinking
"whenever X is true, also Y is true" writes one rule, not four
different shapes. It composes with everything else — the `then`
effects can use `invoke_action`, `for_each`, expressions, etc.

## Edge cases

- ``when`` is a standard predicate expression — same grammar as
  preconditions and termination expressions
- ``for_each`` is optional; if omitted, the rule fires globally (no
  per-entity scope), useful for world-level facts like "if total gold
  exceeds 1000, trigger inflation"
- ``once_per_entity`` (or ``once_global``) prevents storm-firing
- Rules fire AFTER agent turns, BEFORE termination check — so they
  can change state that terminations then see (e.g. mark someone
  dead → ``last_one_standing`` fires the same round)
