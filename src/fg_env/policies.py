    Each turn it picks a uniformly random action name from

    Deterministic — including under concurrency: every entity gets its own
    RNG stream, derived stably from ``(seed, entity_id)`` via SHA-256, so
    the same seed replays the same choices even when the engine collects
    decisions from thread-pool workers (simultaneous/parallel phases), and
    one entity's rolls never shift another's. Global random state is never
    touched.

    What it does and doesn't handle:

    - **Target-less actions** — always constructable; this is the core case.
    - **Targeted actions** (``target_type`` set) — handled only when
      ``state`` is bound (``simulate()`` binds it automatically): a random
      alive entity of the declared target type (other than the actor) is
      chosen. If no valid target exists, or no ``state`` is bound, the
      action is skipped as un-constructable.
    - **Actions with required parameters** — never attempted when ``state``
      is bound (the policy cannot invent meaningful values); without
      ``state`` it cannot see parameter specs, so such actions are
      attempted bare and may fail resolution.

    Returns ``None`` (skip the turn) when nothing constructable remains.
