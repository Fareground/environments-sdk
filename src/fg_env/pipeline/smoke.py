"""smoke_test() — fast mocked-decision playtester for compiled worlds.

Runs a compiled engine for N rounds with mocked agent decisions (no
real LLM calls). Returns a structured report covering:

  - Did the game crash?
  - Did a termination fire? Which one?
  - Which actions actually got taken?
  - Action coverage % (how many declared actions ever fired)
  - Number of distinct events emitted

This is the agent's TIGHT iteration loop. Real LLM playtests are slow
($), flaky, and burn agent context. The smoke test is deterministic
(seed-controlled), fast (~ms), and gives the agent enough signal to
know its template is structurally sound.

## Decision strategies

  - ``"random"``       — uniform choice among valid actions each turn
  - ``"first"``        — always pick the first listed valid action
  - ``"round_robin"``  — rotate through declared actions in order
  - ``callable``       — bring your own decision_fn for targeted tests

## Usage

    from fg_env import compile_template, smoke_test

    result = compile_template(raw_json)
    if not result.ok:
        return result
    report = smoke_test(result.engine, rounds=20, seed=42)
    if not report.healthy:
        print(report.summary())
