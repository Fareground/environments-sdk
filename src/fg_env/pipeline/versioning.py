"""Contract version negotiation for WorldTemplate.

When the kernel's JSON contract changes, old templates need a
migration path. This module:

  1. Defines the current ``CONTRACT_VERSION``
  2. Records ``contract_version`` on every emitted template
  3. Provides a migration registry — register an upgrade function
     under the version it should LIFT ABOVE
  4. ``upgrade_template(raw)`` walks the migration chain until the
     template is at the current version

## Usage

    from fg_env.pipeline.versioning import (
        CONTRACT_VERSION, register_migration, upgrade_template,
    )

    @register_migration("1.0")
    def _v1_to_v2(raw: dict) -> dict:
        # Move runtime_parameters under settings/
        raw["settings"] = {"runtime_parameters": raw.pop("runtime_parameters", [])}
        raw["contract_version"] = "2.0"
        return raw

A template tagged ``"contract_version": "1.0"`` then flows through
``_v1_to_v2`` before compile.

## Version format

Semver-ish. Compare as strings — the ordering of registered
migrations defines the chain. Don't skip versions; if you go
v1.0 → v3.0, register one migration that takes v1.0 → v2.0 and
another that takes v2.0 → v3.0. ``upgrade_template`` chains them.

## Backwards compatibility

Templates without ``contract_version`` are treated as the **earliest
known version** and walked through every registered migration. This
covers every existing ``assets/<game>/template.json`` file in the
repo today.
