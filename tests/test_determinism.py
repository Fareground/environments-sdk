"""Golden-seed determinism guarantee.

The README and engine docstring promise: *"deterministic given the same seed
and LLM responses."* These tests lock that promise in. A run is reproducible
iff two runs with the same seed and the same (deterministic) decision_fn
produce byte-identical event logs — modulo the wall-clock ``timestamp`` field.

If a future change reintroduces nondeterminism (global RNG, set iteration,
completion-order resolution), one of these tests goes red.
